# Functionality
* Add a task
* Modify a task
* Delete a task

# How it Works
I have used the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to save and fetch all the data. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is used to send the async requests from frontend.

# What I Used
* NodeJS/Express
* HTML5/CSS3
* MongoDB
* Axios

# Can you contribute?
You can make/suggest enhancements of your own by sending a pull request.

# What I learned
This was my first project with the NodeJS. This project taught me about `NodeJS`, `Express`, `MongoDB` and `Axios`.
